# Sequence score

## Notes on this solution

The tooltip of the [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/173/) that inspired this challenge makes a reference to the Travelling
Salesman Problem and I decided to use something akin to the simple greedy solution to that problem which tends to
yield good results.

I improved the result of the greedy algorithm by looking for pair-wise swaps that improved the overall sequence score.
